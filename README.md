# A/B Testing
## Project Overview
SmartAd is a mobile first advertiser agency. It designs intuitive touch-enabled advertising. It provides brands with an automated advertising experience via machine learning and creative excellence. Their company is based on the principle of voluntary participation which is proven to increase brand engagement and memorability 10 x more than static alternatives. 
SmartAd provides an additional service called Brand Impact Optimiser (BIO), a lightweight questionnaire, served with every campaign to determine the impact of the creative, the ad they design, on various upper funnel metrics, including memorability and brand sentiment. 
As a Machine learning engineer in SmartAd, one of our tasks was to design a reliable hypothesis testing algorithm for the BIO service and to determine whether a recent advertising campaign resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.
## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is the cornerstone of evidence based decision making. The A/B testing framework is the most used statistical framework for making gradual but important changes in every aspect of todayâ€™s business.
## Results
We performed two types of hypothesis testing algorithms on our data. We performed A classical ```z-test``` and the ```Evan Miller Sequential A/B test```. Our results are found in jupyter notebook in the ```notebooks``` folder.
